    ## Purpose

    Versioned ETF universe strength and context.

    ## Owner and authority

    Owner: ETF Direction domain. This object is the authoritative record for its bounded purpose only. It does not assume responsibilities owned by adjacent domains.

    ## Inputs

    Identified upstream artifacts, timezone-aware semantic times, exact model/config/code identities and explicit data/evidence status.

    ## Schema V1

    - `decision_time`
- `etf_universe_identity`
- `rankings`
- `relative_strength`
- `turnover_expansion`
- `breadth`
- `persistence`
- `flow_proxies`
- `data_quality`
- `evidence_level`
- `content_hash`

    ## Identity and versioning

    Result-affecting fields enter the canonical content hash. Schema or semantic changes create a new version. Corrections use `supersedes` and preserve the original.

    ## Time and PIT rules

    All inputs must be defensibly available by the object's Decision/As-Of Time. Future outcomes are stored only after observation and never fed back into original predictions.

    ## Invariants

    1. No current-component backfill.
2. ETF direction is not automatically a stock gate.

    ## Validation and failure behavior

    Validate required references, type/range constraints, identity compatibility, freshness, population coverage and authority ceiling. Missing mandatory evidence fails closed with an explicit status; it never fabricates a default value.

    ## Example status

    ```text
    AVAILABLE | NOT_YET_OBSERVED | INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE | DATA_BLOCKED | INVALID
    ```

    ## Non-goals

    No automatic order, no silent data promotion, no mutable overwrite, no Alpha or probability claim without evidence.

    ## Migration

    Phase D introduces this canonical contract. Legacy fields may be exposed through an adapter only after characterization tests prove semantic compatibility.
